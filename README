[ros-performance-catkin-ws]
This is the performance testing catkin workspace for ros1.x, including latency node, throughput node. It requried ros kinetic was install on your localhost.

2. cd into catkin workspace folder and compile it.
   cd ros-performance-catkin-ws
   catkin_make
3. run testing, here is an example for 2 subscriber testing.
   rosrun latency_test talker -n 2 -s <number> -l <size> [-u | --unreliable]
   rosrun latency_test listener [-u|--unreliable]  __name:=node0
   rosrun latency_test listener [-u|--unreliable]  __name:=node1
